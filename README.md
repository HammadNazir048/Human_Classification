1.1. Overview:
The Human Classification System employs technologies, including deep learning and computer vision, to swiftly and accurately identify human subjects in CCTV images. 
This system streamlines the process, ensuring efficient detection in real-time surveillance scenarios.

1.2.  Problem statement:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust Human Detection System that can automatically identify and locate human subjects within CCTV images. 
The system aims to enhance security surveillance, public safety, and law enforcement by providing accurate and timely human detection capabilities.
 
1.3.  Objective of the project:
Primary objectives are as follows:

•	To detect humans under restricted areas using CCTV.
•	Automating surveillance.

1.4. Scope of the project:
The scope of the Human Detection System project includes:

•	Providing a tool for the rapid and accurate identification of human subjects in CCTV images.

•	Enabling seamless integration into security and surveillance applications to monitor and detect individuals in public spaces, airports, and critical locations.

•	Enhancing public safety by automating the identification process in real-time.

1.5. Data Collection:

The dataset contains images divided in two folders ‘0’ and ‘1’ having images of CCTV frames without and with humans.
